### üå± Smart Agriculture System

A sustainable smart agriculture project built around an **ESP32**, **soil moisture sensor**, and **solar-powered system**. It features a **custom PCB** and a **homemade Power Management System (PMS)** that manages charging and power delivery from a solar panel and lithium-ion battery. The goal is to create a reliable, low-cost, and energy-efficient system for automatic irrigation and smart farming.

## üî® How to Build It Yourself

1. **Assemble PMS:** Connect solar panel ‚Üí PMS ‚Üí lithium-ion battery.
2. **Power ESP32:** Use PMS regulated 5V output to power ESP32 VIN.
3. **Connect Components:**

   * Soil sensor ‚Üí Analog pin
   * Relay ‚Üí Digital pin
   * Pump ‚Üí Relay output
4. **Upload Code:** Flash the firmware from `/software` using Arduino IDE.
5. **Monitor & Test:** Check soil readings and verify auto pump control.
